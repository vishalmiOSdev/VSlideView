# VSlideView

SwipeToLockUnlock is an iOS application that demonstrates a swipe gesture to lock and unlock the device's screen. The swipe gesture is implemented using `UIPanGestureRecognizer`, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.

 Overview

 What This Code Does

This project features a swipeable button that users can drag horizontally to trigger different actions:

- Swipe Right: Changes the button to indicate the device is "locked."
- Swipe Left: Resets the button to indicate the device is "unlocked."

The UI updates dynamically based on the swipe direction, changing colors and icons to reflect the lock/unlock state.

 Why I Created This

I noticed a lack of simple, example projects demonstrating how to implement a swipe-to-action UI element using Swift and UIKit. Many available resources are either too complex or do not cover this specific use case. Therefore, I decided to create and share this project to help others understand how to build similar functionality in their iOS applications.

 Features

- Smooth Swipe Gesture Handling: Using `UIPanGestureRecognizer` to track user interaction.
- Dynamic UI Updates: Visual feedback based on the swipe direction.
- Customizable Components: Easily change colors, images, and other properties to fit your needs.


Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the swipe gesture by modifying the following properties in `ViewController.swift`:

- `leadingSpace` and `trailingSpace`: Adjust the spaces at the edges of the swipe view.
- `swipeView.layer.cornerRadius` and `thumbNailButton.layer.cornerRadius`: Change the corner radius for rounded edges.
- `swipeView.backgroundColor` and `thumbNailButton.backgroundColor`: Set the background colors.
- `swipeText.text`: Update the instructional text displayed.
